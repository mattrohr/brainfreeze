## About
When imaging the brain, breathing causes image shift <sup>[1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22108978/)</sup> and may cause the image to drift in and out of focus. This repository includes hardware and software to counteract this motion in realtime.

## Installation
1. Purchase [bill of materials](./docs/BOM.xlsx)

2. [Configure operating system on acquisition computer](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi)

3. Place inertial measurement unit on flat surface and [connect to acquisition computer](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-9-dof-orientation-imu-fusion-breakout-bno085/python-circuitpython). It does not matter which female connector you choose.

4. Calibrate sensor by placing inertial measurement unit waiting about 10 seconds. Rotate sensor about all axis for about 10 seconds. Rotate IMU sensor about all axis for about 10 seconds.

4. Copy this repository on both host computer and acquisition computer so it may write files:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattrohr/compensation-stage.git
```
5. Grant python script executable permissions:
```
chmod u+x ./src/record_kinematics.py
```
6. Sterilize components with alcohol wipes to minimize infection risk. Because of the low water content in 99% alcohol wipes, evaporation is quick and you may need to use several wipes. 

7. After board dries, apply black gaffer tape to red raspberry pi and green IMU LED status indicators to prevent contaminating oxygenation measurement.

8. Attach IMU sensor Scotch double-sided adhesive square. The sensor has an orientation compass on the bottom right. Position the compass so it faces up, Y points to the snout, X points to the right ear, and the sensor is close to the cranial window. Ideally this area should be shaven for a secure fit.

## Usage
1. Run the demo with provided sample data. Results are located in [`data/final`](./data/final/20210408-190706_sensor-orbit_100RPM).
```bash
matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -r "run('./src/calculate_kinematics.m');exit;" 
```

2. Log into acquisition computer and record your own data:
```python
ssh pi@raspberrypi
./src/record_kinematics.py
```

4. On host computer, transfer data from acquisition computer:
```bash
./src/transfer_data.sh
```

6. Sterilize components again with alcohol wipe to remove tape residue and contaminants.

## Notes
Design Considerations:
- Sensor:
    - IMU: cheap ($20), ease of assembly because it's solder-less, fast sampling rate (500 [Hz]) which is well above Nyquist sampling rate 2.84 [Hz] (2 * [expected motion of 85 breaths per minute](http://web.jhu.edu/animalcare/procedures/rat.html) / 60 seconds)
    - LIDAR and photogrammetry: may interfere with already-crowded spectrum (red/green for oxygenation, blue for optogenetic stimulation, red also for blood velocity, infrared for OCT). We could choose a LIDAR unit that emits at a different wavelength, but no access to our power meter to verify emission spectrum.
    - magnetometer / hall sensor: The sensor has a limited working range--[our magnets](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01I1XNV0I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) easily saturated the sensor. Field-strength quickly dropped as magnet moved away and undetectable because inverse square law. [Hemoglobin is magnetic](https://twitter.com/rainmaker1973/status/1019877124952481792), so a strong magnet may disrupt one of the measurements we're making.
    - test indicator / dial indicator: [test indicator is susceptible to cosine effect](https://www.mitutoyo.co.jp/eng/products/menu/QuickGuide_Dial-Indicators.pdf#page=4), [Mitutoyo ID-C](https://www.amazon.com/Mitutoyo-543-392B-Digimatic-Resolution-Specifications/dp/B002SG7PI4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mitutoyo+id-c&qid=1619141916&sr=8-1) digital read out and has the most frequent sampling, but it's still slower than our IMU (100 [Hz] vs 500 [Hz]), expensive ($400 vs $20 IMU), only measures 1-D. Starett said their fastest sampling rate was once every 5 seconds--seems too slow, my question was probably misunderstood.
    - [motion capture suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_capture): we don't need full body motion, just cortex motion. So we'd need several reflective orbs around an area already-packed with life support equipment.
    - ultrasonic sensor: limited working range because of the conical beam. Also the emission point is at a different point than the detection path. Because we're measuring a curved object, the distance we'd read would not be the real distance. Cheap off-the-shelf models are only accurate to around a couple [cm], insufficient for our purposes.
    - OCT feedback
    - Radar
    - GPS: good for Â±1 [m], not [mm], [um], or [nm]
- Redundant method: camera
- Sensor mounting
    - medical-grade tape: [Nitto ST-2604](https://www.nitto.com/us/en/products/medical/003/) is breathable and non-irritating but difficult to source. You have to buy cases instead of individual rolls. Same story for 3M equivalents.
    - normal double sided tape: too high tensile strength will rip PCB pads and/or skin, cause skin irritation, non-breathable so moisture buildup and subsequent detachment
    - snap connector: difficult to source, Digi-key doesn't stock them. [Alibaba does](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/PCB-electrode-button-Medical-button-snap_60687245853.html). But now instead of figuring out how to mount the sensor to the rodent, we just push off the problem and now have to figure out how best to attach the snap connector to the sensor.
    - [veterinary glue](https://www.amazon.com/3M-Vetbond-084-1469SB-Vetbond-Tissue-Adhesive-1469Sb/dp/B004C12Q46):
    - single sided athletic tape:
    - double sided foam adhesive squares: Scotch Removable Mounting Square. Readily available at retail stores. 1 [lb] tensile strength seems adequately sticky. But because they're foam, they have 2 +/- 0.2 [mm] lateral and axial movement when squashed. They're pretty rigid, precut, perfectly sized, cheap. Adequate until we can source thinner, double-sided medical tape. No perceptible residue.
- stabilization method
    - optical stabilization (move lens)
    - in-body stabilization (move sensor)
    - digital stabilization (move objective)
    - subject stabilization (this method)
- Sensor sampling period: Nyquist sampling frequency
- Stage resolution
- Stage response time
- Stage speed
- Stage vertical load capacity: > 17 [lbs] because Kopf stereotaxic holder is about 15 [lbs], adult lab rats are about 1 to 2 [lbs].
- FFT filter type and parameters: highpass

Drawbacks:
- Because we're integrating acceleration to calculate position, we're also accumulating sensor bias. Overtime the sensor reading will drift away from the true value. However because breathing is cyclic, we have a lower and upper bound on displacement in X- Y- and Z-axes. For example, we can detrend by assigning all troughs a value of zero, and likewise for signal peaks. <img align="right" width="50%" crop src="https://i.imgur.com/YwBZfIa.png" alt="IMU sensor drift"> Nevertheless.

 position accumulating error because we're integrating acceleration twice. 
- induced motor motion
- sampling time: irregular, interpolation necessary.
- inertia of stage
- sensor is big, and is too big for smaller specimen this system could be used for.
- IMU only measures bulk motion and the stage can only correct for bulk motion, not localized micro-motion.
- brain is curved, IMU measures kinematics at only one point... This compensates bulk motion... Could add multiple IMU's, but more likely, LIDAR.
